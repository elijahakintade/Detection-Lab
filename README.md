# SOC Automation Lab

## Objective

This lab is aim to develop an integrated Security Operations Center (SOC) automation framework leveraging Wazuh, Shuffle, and The Hive platforms, aimed at enhancing incident detection, response, and remediation capabilities while optimizing resource utilization and reducing response times.
By achieving these objectives, the SOC will benefit from enhanced operational efficiency, reduced response times, and improved resilience against evolving cyber threats, ultimately bolstering the organization's overall security posture.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Wazuh is an open-source security monitoring platform used for threat detection.
- TheHive is an open-source incident response platform that helps security teams manage and investigate security incidents
- Shuffle: A general purpose security automation platform
