# Detection Lab

## Objective

To develop an integrated Security Operations Center (SOC) automation framework leveraging Wazuh, Shuffle, and The Hive platforms, aimed at enhancing incident detection, response, and remediation capabilities while optimizing resource utilization and reducing response times.
By achieving these objectives, the SOC will benefit from enhanced operational efficiency, reduced response times, and improved resilience against evolving cyber threats, ultimately bolstering the organization's overall security posture.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
